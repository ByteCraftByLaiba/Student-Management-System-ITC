## 🚀 Complexity Level
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
This project is designed for beginner-level learners, focusing on the use of basic control structures such as if-else, switch statements, loops (while, for, do-while), and static arrays. It provides a fundamental introduction to student record management in a console application.

## 📖 Overview
The **Student Management System** is a simple C++ console-based application developed for managing student records. It allows users to perform various tasks such as viewing, inserting, and updating records, as well as finding students based on different criteria like highest CGPA or academic probation. The project demonstrates basic concepts of programming and control flow.

## ✨ Features
- 📄 **View** a student record.
- ➕ **Insert** a new student record.
- 📝 **Alter** an existing record.
- 🏫 **Display records** by section or course.
- 🎓 **Identify** the student with the highest and lowest CGPA.
- 📝 **List** students with mid-term marks below 50 or with zero marks in Quiz 2.
- 🚩 **Display** students on academic probation.
- 🔄 **Update** individual student marks for mid-term and quizzes.
- 📑 **Show** all student records.

## 💻 Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Control Structures:** If-else, Switch statements
- **Loops:** While, For, Do-while
- **Data Structures:** Static arrays

## ⚙️ Project Setup / Installation
1. **Clone** the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ByteCraftByLaiba/Student-Management-System-ITC.git
   ```
2. **Navigate** to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Student-Management-System-ITC
   ```
3. **Compile** the code using any C++ compiler.
4. **Run** the compiled program to access the menu-driven student management system.

## 🔧 How to Use
1. Run the program and select an option from the menu.
2. Perform operations such as viewing, inserting, or altering records.
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to manage student data.

## 🌟 Future Enhancements
- 📂 **Implement** file handling for persistent storage of student records.
- 💾 **Introduce** dynamic memory management to handle larger datasets.
- 🖥️ **Add** a graphical user interface (GUI) to improve user interaction.

## 💡 Challenges Faced
Understanding and implementing static arrays and control flow was crucial in handling the various options provided in the system. The use of loops and switch cases was integral to making the application menu-driven and user-friendly.
