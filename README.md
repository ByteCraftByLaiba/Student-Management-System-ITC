## Complexity Level
**Difficulty:** Beginner  
This project is designed for beginner-level learners, focusing on the use of basic control structures such as if-else, switch statements, loops (while, for, do-while), and static arrays. It provides a fundamental introduction to student record management in a console application.

## Overview
The Student Management System is a simple C++ console-based application developed for managing student records. It allows users to perform various tasks such as viewing, inserting, and updating records, as well as finding students based on different criteria like highest CGPA or academic probation. The project demonstrates basic concepts of programming and control flow.

## Features
- View a student record.
- Insert a new student record.
- Alter an existing record.
- Display records by section or course.
- Identify the student with the highest and lowest CGPA.
- List students with mid-term marks below 50 or with zero marks in Quiz 2.
- Display students on academic probation.
- Update individual student marks for mid-term and quizzes.
- Show all student records.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language:** C++
- **Control Structures:** If-else, Switch statements
- **Loops:** While, For, Do-while
- **Data Structures:** Static arrays
